A **Simple**, **Minimalist** Template for Noir Projects.

## Getting Started

Click [`use this template`](https://github.com/whitenois3/nplate/generate) to create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

## Development

Both hardhat and foundry are supported.
With the help of the `ffi`, you can write complex JS/TS scripts, feed them inputs FROM the foundry test contract and use the output in the test contract.

**Setup**
```bash
npm install
```
Regarding the installation of `nargo`, please refer to its repo [here](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir).

**Building**
```bash
cd circuits
nargo build
nargo compile BUILD_NAME
```

**Testing**
```bash
npx hardhat test
```
```bash
forge test --ffi
```

We have provided two bash scripts in `utils/` to make your life easier when it comes to generating the Verifier contract and a proof.

```
./utils/safeGenerateContract.sh
./utils/safeGenerateProof.sh
```
